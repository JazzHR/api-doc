# Verification Event

During setup, the JazzHR platform will send an HTTP POST with an **empty payload** to the configured URL to determine if it has been set up correctly.

The given endpoint must respond with a status code of 200 to be considered configured correctly to receive any other webhook events from JazzHR.

HTTP POST payloads that are delivered to your webhookâ€™s configured URL endpoint will contain a special identifying header:

Header | Description
------ | -----------
X-JazzHR-Event | Event type indicator. Header value will be `VERIFY`
