# Overview

This is the official documentation for the JazzHR Candidate Export Webhook.

The Candidate Export Webhook allows partners to build custom endpoints and subscribe
to export events that happen via manual or automatic user actions within the JazzHR platform.
When a candidate export is triggered, we will send an HTTP POST payload to the configured URL.
